# Config
In this folder you find the config files, which are used in different pnpm workspaces, ie `frontend` and `backend`. Each setup gets a different config file.


### TODO
* Make `tunnel` setup operational
* A workflow to automate building cellajs.com with the main branch, while having the template code ready for a clean installation.
* A CLI interface that serves a migration guide when there are (breaking) changes in the cella config.
