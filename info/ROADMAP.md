# Roadmap
For now, we maintain a very rough roadmap here. Its a work in progress and things will get added, removed and changed. We will eventually manage a roadmap elsewhere.

## Current challenges
* Undecided on rendering strategy: the plan is to have a hybrid rendering strategy, with CSR being the most common rendering mode. There are many open source libraries working on this.

## Current projects
* [Lucia Auth v3](https://lucia-auth.com/)
* Modularity / file structure
* Lots of refactoring

## Future: Modularity
* A scaffolding solution is necessary to keep the template useful while the project is growing. Perhaps we can collaborate with a dev which is already maintaining a scaffolding tool?

## Future: Authorization
* [CASL](https://casl.js.org/)

## Future: Testing
* Vitest + Playwright with visual regression testing?! How does Storybook fit in here?
* Automated security audit / testing solution

## Future: Optional third party tooling
* [Hanko](https://www.hanko.io/) (OS, German) for more security/auth options
* [Gleap.io](https://www.gleap.io/) (German) for chat support
* [OhDear](https://ohdear.app/) (Belgium) for status pages
