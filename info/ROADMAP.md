# Roadmap
For now, we maintain a very rough roadmap here. Its a work in progress and things will get added, removed and changed. We will eventually manage a roadmap elsewhere.

## Current projects
* Modularity / file structure
* [imado.eu](imado.eu) for file handling
* Passkey authentication
* A customizable, extendable permission system
* Performance testing


## Future: Modularity
* A scaffolding solution is necessary to keep the template useful while the project is growing. Perhaps we can collaborate with a dev which is already maintaining a scaffolding tool?
* Notifications module

## Future: Testing
* Vitest + Playwright with visual regression testing?! How does Storybook fit in here?
* Automated security audit / testing solution

## Future: Optional third party tooling
Some optional third party tooling has already been integration. More work will be done
* [MessageBird](https://messagebird.com/) (Dutch) as a partner, ie for emails and sms?!
* [Scaleway TEM](https://www.scaleway.com/en/transactional-email-tem/) (France) for transactional email
* [Twenty](https://twenty.com/) (France) for and OS CRM
* [Storybook](https://storybook.js.org/) for UI: [https://github.com/shadcn-ui/ui/pull/1561](https://github.com/shadcn-ui/ui/pull/1561)
* [Mave.io](https://www.mave.io/) (Dutch) for videos
* [StaticHost](https://www.statichost.eu/) (Sweden) as alternative to Netlify/Render

## Future: Native app support
* [CapacitorJS](https://github.com/ionic-team/capacitor) (OS) for native app support
* [Electron-Vite](https://github.com/electron-vite/electron-vite-react) or [Tauri](https://github.com/tauri-apps/tauri) (OS) for desktop app support
